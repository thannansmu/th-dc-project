   To do this, enter the following into the terminal:
   ```pip3 install flask```

3. Enter the following terminal command: ```python3 main.py```
4. Text should pop up in the terminal and it should give you a link
5. Paste the link in a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc)


#### Option 2: Running on Website
You can also run the program using the following link: <link>


## Steps for using the program
1. Enter formula into the text box
2. Press enter

## Syntax
- Characters you can use for the symbols are on the main page
- Conclusion is optional
- Must have at least one premise (no conclusion only formulas)
- Simplify negations before typing them in. Example: ~~P must be typed in as P
- IMPORTANT: Program does not assume parentheses, so you must type them out
Example: P /\ Q -> R must be typed in as (P /\ Q) -> R
